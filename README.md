Can I write a browser addon that is implemented in Rust?

Yes, you can write a browser add-on implemented in Rust by compiling the Rust code to WebAssembly (WASM) and using JavaScript as a bridge for browser integration. This way, you can leverage Rust performance capabilities within the browser environment.

Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. Write Rust code: Implement the core functionality of your add-on using Rust.

2. Compile to WebAssembly: Convert the Rust code to WebAssembly using `wasm-pack` or `cargo wasm`.

3. Create a JavaScript wrapper: Write a JavaScript module that imports and calls your WebAssembly code.

4. Create the add-on: Create a new folder with a `manifest.json` file containing your add-on's metadata, following the WebExtensions API standards.

5. Include JavaScript and WebAssembly: Copy the generated `.wasm` file and the JavaScript wrapper module to the new folder.

6. Implement event listeners and hooks: Use the WebExtensions API to trigger the functionality provided by your Rust code when needed (e.g., on-click events, page load events).

7. Package and distribute: Package your add-on for distribution according to the guidelines for each respective browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.).

For Firefox, you can refer to the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation on creating WebExtensions:

- WebExtensions homepage: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions
- Your first WebExtension: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension

Where is the best place to start?

The best place to start is by familiarizing yourself with the essential concepts and technology stack by going through the following resources:

1. Rust Programming Language: Learn Rust basics and the language's mechanics by reading the official Rust book at https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/.

2. WebAssembly (WASM): Understand WebAssembly concepts, how it works, and its relationship with JavaScript at https://webassembly.org/.

3. wasm-bindgen & wasm-pack: Familiarize yourself with `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-pack` tools for compiling Rust to WebAssembly and generating JavaScript bindings. Review the official wasm-bindgen guide at https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/ and the wasm-pack documentation at https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/.

4. WebExtensions API: Read the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation on creating WebExtensions, which covers important concepts for browser add-ons, including manifest files, background scripts, content scripts, and browser APIs. Begin with the "Your first WebExtension" tutorial at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension.

Once you are comfortable with the technologies, proceed with the following steps:

1. Write a Rust function that implements your add-on's core functionality.

2. Compile the Rust code to WebAssembly using wasm-pack or cargo wasm.

3. Create a JavaScript wrapper that imports and interacts with the WebAssembly module.

4. Implement event listeners and hooks using the WebExtensions API to execute your add-on's Rust code when needed.

5. Package and distribute your add-on according to each browser's guidelines.

Remember to start small; focus on building a simple add-on and then gradually enhance its functionality as you gain confidence in your knowledge of Rust, WebAssembly, and the WebExtensions API.

What context does a Firefox extension run in?

A Firefox extension typically runs in two separate contexts:

1. Content scripts: These scripts can directly access and manipulate the content of a web page loaded in a browser tab. Content scripts run in the context of the web page they're injected into, with a few limitations. They can't access the JavaScript objects or functions created by web pages, and they run in an isolated scope to prevent name collision issues. Communication with other parts of the extension is done via the messaging system.

2. Background scripts: These scripts run in the background and have access to a broader range of WebExtension APIs, such as browser action, context menus, and web requests. Background scripts run in an isolated environment called an "Extension Page," which is essentially an invisible (headless) HTML page. They do not have direct access to web pages but can interact with them using content scripts and messaging.

It's important to note that Firefox extensions don't run directly in Rust, as WebExtension APIs are JavaScript-based. However, Rust code can be compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) and then used within an extension. This way, you can run Rust code in combination with JavaScript in your extension, but the interactions with WebExtension APIs still need to be done via JavaScript.
