Can I write a browser addon that is implemented in Rust?

Yes, you can write a browser add-on implemented in Rust by compiling the Rust code to WebAssembly (WASM) and using JavaScript as a bridge for browser integration. This way, you can leverage Rust performance capabilities within the browser environment.

Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. Write Rust code: Implement the core functionality of your add-on using Rust.

2. Compile to WebAssembly: Convert the Rust code to WebAssembly using `wasm-pack` or `cargo wasm`.

3. Create a JavaScript wrapper: Write a JavaScript module that imports and calls your WebAssembly code.

4. Create the add-on: Create a new folder with a `manifest.json` file containing your add-on's metadata, following the WebExtensions API standards.

5. Include JavaScript and WebAssembly: Copy the generated `.wasm` file and the JavaScript wrapper module to the new folder.

6. Implement event listeners and hooks: Use the WebExtensions API to trigger the functionality provided by your Rust code when needed (e.g., on-click events, page load events).

7. Package and distribute: Package your add-on for distribution according to the guidelines for each respective browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.).

For Firefox, you can refer to the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation on creating WebExtensions:

- WebExtensions homepage: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions
- Your first WebExtension: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension

Where is the best place to start?

The best place to start is by familiarizing yourself with the essential concepts and technology stack by going through the following resources:

1. Rust Programming Language: Learn Rust basics and the language's mechanics by reading the official Rust book at https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/.

2. WebAssembly (WASM): Understand WebAssembly concepts, how it works, and its relationship with JavaScript at https://webassembly.org/.

3. wasm-bindgen & wasm-pack: Familiarize yourself with `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-pack` tools for compiling Rust to WebAssembly and generating JavaScript bindings. Review the official wasm-bindgen guide at https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/ and the wasm-pack documentation at https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/.

4. WebExtensions API: Read the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation on creating WebExtensions, which covers important concepts for browser add-ons, including manifest files, background scripts, content scripts, and browser APIs. Begin with the "Your first WebExtension" tutorial at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension.

Once you are comfortable with the technologies, proceed with the following steps:

1. Write a Rust function that implements your add-on's core functionality.

2. Compile the Rust code to WebAssembly using wasm-pack or cargo wasm.

3. Create a JavaScript wrapper that imports and interacts with the WebAssembly module.

4. Implement event listeners and hooks using the WebExtensions API to execute your add-on's Rust code when needed.

5. Package and distribute your add-on according to each browser's guidelines.

Remember to start small; focus on building a simple add-on and then gradually enhance its functionality as you gain confidence in your knowledge of Rust, WebAssembly, and the WebExtensions API.

How can I call a Rust function from my context script?

To call a Rust function from your content script, you should compile your Rust code to WebAssembly (Wasm) first, then load and execute the Wasm module within your content script. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

Note: To follow this guide, make sure you've installed Rust and its WebAssembly target. If you haven't, visit https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install to install Rust and run `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` to add the wasm target.

1. Create a Rust library project:
```sh
cargo new --lib rust_wasm_module
cd rust_wasm_module
```

2. Edit `Cargo.toml` to create a wasm target:
```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
```

3. Edit `src/lib.rs` to define a Rust function you want to call from your content script:
```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

4. Build the Rust library as Wasm:
```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

5. In the `rust_wasm_module` folder, install `wasm-bindgen-cli` (if you haven't already) and generate the necessary JavaScript bindings:

```sh
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/rust_wasm_module.wasm --out-dir wasm_output
```

6. Copy `rust_wasm_module/wasm_output/rust_wasm_module_bg.wasm` and `rust_wasm_module/wasm_output/rust_wasm_module.js` files to the folder of your Firefox extension (where `manifest.json` and `content-script.js` are located).

7. Update the `content-script.js` of your Firefox extension to import the Wasm module and call the Rust function:

```javascript
(async () => {
  // Import the wasm module and its initialization function
  const rustWasmModule = await import("./rust_wasm_module.js");

  // Initialize and instantiate the wasm module
  const wasm = await rustWasmModule.default();

  // Call the Rust function 'add' from the wasm module
  const a = 42;
  const b = 13;
  const result = wasm.add(a, b);

  // Log the result to the console
  console.log(`${a} + ${b} = ${result}`); // Should log: "42 + 13 = 55"
})();
```

8. Update the `manifest.json` to allow fetching local Wasm modules:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Call Rust Function Addon",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "A content script addon that calls a Rust function compiled to WebAssembly",
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["*://*/*"],
      "js": ["content-script.js"]
    }
  ],
  "permissions": ["activeTab"],
  "web_accessible_resources": ["rust_wasm_module_bg.wasm"]
}
```

Now, follow the steps from previous answers to load the add-on in Firefox. The content script should call the Rust `add` function from the WebAssembly module and log the result to the console.

Be aware that the performance overhead caused by loading WebAssembly modules might not be ideal for very simple functions. Consider using WebAssembly for more computationally intensive tasks, where the performance benefits become more apparent.
